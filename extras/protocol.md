# Themis

The primary purpose is to create real world data that will be used by Achilles Heel.
As a result, aggregated outputs from Themis study will be made public. See results subfolder for example outputs. 
This is predominantly informatics study with limited clinical component.

# Analyzed data

The input to the study are .CSV files that represent aggregated data about use of concept codes.

# IRB review
The study is not using directly patient level data. Only Achilles pre-computed data are used. Sites are encouraged to use a small cell sizes exclusion filter in Achilles that is prefered by their dataset administrators. The study is targeting datsets with existing IRB protocols around an OMOP dataset. See http://www.ohdsi.org/web/wiki/doku.php?id=research:irb_protocols

# Use of your data

Centralized processing will parse your dataset's data and aggregate the results. Individual dataset's results (unaggregated) will never be made public to protect the participating data partners.
After the study completion, submitted individual dataset data will be deleted.


# Publication

Once final conventions are created, the results will be published in an academic article or abstract. Participating data partners will have a chance to contribute and revise the article.
